# Patrik Pospisil - Portfolio Web

Welcome to my personal portfolio web application!

This project was created as part of my journey to transition into the IT industry.  
I am a motivated career changer who completed programming courses in **C#** and **Python**, and I am currently building my skills in **web development** using **ASP.NET Core (Razor Pages)**.

Although I don't have commercial IT experience yet, I am committed to learning and proving my capabilities through real projects like this one.
