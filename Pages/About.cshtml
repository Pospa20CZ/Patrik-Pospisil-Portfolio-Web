                            Hi, I'm Patrik – a motivated career changer with a strong background in People Solutions and international communication.
                            After several years in HR roles at Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue, I've decided to follow my passion for technology and software development.

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            I've completed certified online courses in Python and C#, and I'm now focused on building practical web applications using ASP.NET Core and Razor Pages.
                            I'm actively expanding my knowledge in databases, testing, and clean code principles.
                        </p>

                            I’m currently seeking an entry-level opportunity as a Junior Developer or Software Tester where I can apply my skills,
                            learn from experienced colleagues, and contribute with responsibility, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.
